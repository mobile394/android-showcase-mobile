Showcase is a sample project that presents modern, 2019 approach to
[Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) application development using
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and latest tech-stack.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide guidance and present flexible application architecture
(modular, scalable, maintainable and testable architecture suitable for growing teams and longer
[application lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management)). Many of the project design
decisions follows or even extends official Google recommendations.

`Android showcase` is being heavily maintained to match up to date industry standards.

## Project characteristics

This project bring to table set of best practices, tools and solutions:

* 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Modern architecture (feature modules, Clean Architecture, Model-View-ViewModel)
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
* CI pipeline
* Testing
* Static analysis tools
* Dependency Injection
* Material design

## Tech-stack

Min API level is set to [`21`](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=21), so presented approach is suitable for over
[85% of devices](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) running Android. This project takes advantage of many
popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of the libraries are in stable version, unless there is a
good reason to use non-stable dependency.

## Architecture

### Module dependencies

This is simplified diagram of dependencies between gradle modules.

</p>

### Feature structure

Each feature is maximally isolated (code contained in the feature module) to provide better separation of concerns in
the codebase. Single feature contains own set of the Clean Architecture layers (`Presentation`/`Domain`/`Data`), so it
can be developed in isolation, independently from other features.

### App data flow

## Ci pipeline

[CI config](.circleci/config.yml) allows to execute various jobs in parallel eg. app build will not be stared until all
static checks and tests complete successfully.

## What this project does not cover?
The interface of the app utilises some of modern material design components, however is deliberately kept simple to
focus on architecture.

## Improvements

* Support for DayNight MaterialTheme
* [Dynamic Feature modules](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/dynamic-delivery) + Android Dynamic delivery
* Caching layer (memory + disk)
* Add Room
* UI tests (including CI pipeline emulator configuration)
* Data binding
* Custom lint, ktlint and detekt tasks
* Add script to update all dependencies in the project, create PR to run all checks
* Continuous deployment (automatically publish app to Google play store using CI)
* and moreâ€¦
