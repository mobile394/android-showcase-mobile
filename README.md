Showcase is a sample project that presents modern, 2019 approach to
[Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) application development using
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and latest tech-stack.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate best practices, provide a set of guidelines, and present modern Android
application architecture that is modular, scalable, maintainable and testable. This application may look simple, but it
has all of these small details that will set the rock-solid foundation of the larger app suitable for bigger teams and
long [application lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management). Many of the project design
decisions follow official Google recommendations.

This project is being heavily maintained to match current industry standards. In upcoming weeks (Q4 2019) I plan to
write an extensive series of articles explaining many of this project architectural [design decisions](#design-decisions) , so <a
href="https://twitter.com/igorwojda" target="_blank">stay tuned</a>.

## Project characteristics

This project brings to table set of best practices, tools, and solutions:

* 100% [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Modern architecture (feature modules, Clean Architecture, Model-View-ViewModel, Model-View-Intent)
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
* A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to manage fragment operations
* Reactive UI
* CI pipeline
* Testing
* Static analysis tools
* Dependency Injection
* Material design

## Tech-stack

<img src="misc/image/application_anim.gif" width="336" align="right" hspace="20">

Min API level is set to [`21`](https://android-arsenal.com/api?level=21), so the presented approach is suitable for over
[85% of devices](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards) running Android. This project takes advantage of many
popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem. Most of the libraries are in the stable version, unless there is a
good reason to use non-stable dependency.

* Tech-stack
    * [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) + [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - perform background operations
    * [Kodein](https://kodein.org/Kodein-DI/) - dependency injection
    * [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - networking
    * [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
        * [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) - deal with whole in-app navigation
        * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - notify views about database change
        * [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - perform action when lifecycle state changes
        * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
  *   [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - image loading library with Kotlin idiomatic API
  *   [Lottie](http://airbnb.io/lottie) - animation library
    * [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) - application debugging tool
    * [and more...](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/LibraryDependency.kt)

## Architecture

Feature related code is placed inside one of the feature modules. This modularized approach provides better
[separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) in the codebase and allows for feature to
be developed in isolation, independently from other features.

### Module dependencies

This is a simplified diagram of dependencies between gradle modules.

![module_dependencies](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/misc/image/module_dependencies.png?raw=true)

`Clean architecture` is the "core architecture" of the application. Each feature module contains own set of Clean architecture layers. `app` module structure is a bit different, because it mostly contains  "fundamental app configuration" (dependency injection, application class, retrofit configurations, etc.) and code that wire multiple module together (eg. `NavHostActivity`).
> Note that due usage of Android `dynamic-feature` module dependencies are reversed (feature modules are depending on
`app` module, not another way around).

![feature_structure](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/misc/image/module_dependencies_layers.png?raw=true)

Each layer has a distinct set of responsibilities:
- `Presentation layer` - presents data to a screen and handle user interactions
- `Domain layer` - contains business logic
- `Data layer` - access, retrieve and manage application data

![feature_structure](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/misc/image/feature_structure.png?raw=true)

`Presentation` layer is as mix of `MVVM` (Jetpack
`ViewModel` used to preserve data across activity restart) and `MVI` (`actions` modify `common state` of the view and
then new state is edited to a view via `LiveData` to be rendered).

> `common state` (for each view) approach derives from
> [Unidirectional Data Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) and [Redux
> principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles).


### Data flow

Below diagram presents application data flow when a user interacts with `album list screen`:

![app_data_flow](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/master/misc/image/app_data_flow.png?raw=true)

## Ci pipeline

[CI pipeline](circle.yml) verifies project correctness which each PR. Some of the tasks run in parallel, while
others like `app build` will not be stared until all `static checks` and `tests` complete successfully:

![ci_pipeline.jpg](misc/image/ci_pipeline.jpg)

These are all of the Gradle tasks (cmd commands) that are [executed by CI](/circle.yml):
* `./gradlew lintDebug` - runs Android lint
* `./gradlew detekt` - runs detekt
* `./gradlew ktlintCheck` - runs ktlint
* `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` - run unit tests
* `./gradlew :app:bundleDebug` - create app bundle

On top of that project contains custom `./gradlew staticCheck` task that mimics all CI tasks and is intended to run on
local computer.

### Design decisions

Read related articles to have better understanding of underlying design decisions and various trade offs.

* [Multiple ways of defining Clean Architecture layers](https://proandroiddev.com/multiple-ways-of-defining-clean-architecture-layers-bbb70afa5d4a)
* More coming soon (Q4 2019)

## What this project does not cover?

The interface of the app utilises some of modern material design components, however, is deliberately kept simple to
focus on application architecture.

## Upcoming improvements

* Add test coverage support (Jacoco)
* Improve error handling
* Improve multi-module navigation
* UI tests (including CI pipeline emulator configuration)
* Caching layer (memory + disk)
* Android Dynamic delivery
* Add Room
* Data binding
* Add Custom `android lint`, `ktlint` and `detekt` checks/rules
* Add script to update all dependencies in the project, create PR to run all checks
* Continuous deployment (automatically publish app to Google play store using CI)
* Support for DayNight MaterialTheme
* and much moreâ€¦

## Known issues
- API 21 crash on start
- Android Extensions experimental mode doesn't work with Gradle Kotlin DSL ([Fixed in upcoming Kotlin 1.3.60](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-22213))
- CI sometimes fails with ConcurrentModificationException when running various tasks ([Fixed in upcoming Kotlin 1.3.60](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-32853))
- Kotlin option type is not defined ([Fixed in upcoming Kotlin 1.3.60](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-31077))
- `ktlint` ignores multiple file extensions when space is present in `.editorconfig` ([Fixed in upcoming 0.34.2+ release](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint/pull/561))
- `ktlint` `import-ordering` rule conflicts with IDE default formatting rule, so it have to be [disabled](.editorconfig)
- Classes generated by `SafeArgs` plugin (`AlbumListFragmentDirections`, `AlbumDetailFragmentArgs`...) are not properly
  recognized by IDE in the multi-module configuration. Code will run however IDE will mark these classes as non-
  existing. Also sometimes code has to be cleaned before running tests. This needs more investigation.
- False positive "Unused symbol" for a custom Android application class referenced in AndroidManifest.xml file ([Issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/KT-27971))
- False positive "Function can be private" ([Issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-33610))
- Gradle Kotlin Script is not fully supported by Android Studio
- Unit tests are running in IDE but fail after running gradle task because of missing Agrs class ([Issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/139242292))
